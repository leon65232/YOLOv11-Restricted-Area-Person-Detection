Hello ! The project above is a restricted area person detection using YOLOv11, and the usage (take a guess) is to detect if an person is inside an restricted area. 
The detection method can be changed in the UI, and also the area can be defined freely as long as it is a polygon / rectangle.\
To run the project, first git clone the project, then pip install -r requirements.txt, then run streamlit run app.py on the command prompt inside the folder of YOLOv11-Restricted-Area-Person-Detection.
